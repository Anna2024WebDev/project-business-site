# Business Site

My business site with a sign up form for an upcoming event. 

The aim of the third project in the Web Dev bootcamp was to create a responsive business site with a hero image or video in the header  and a sign up form with at least 3 different input types.

## The problem

I started out by scetching out on paper how I wanted it to look like. I took inspiration from a landing page/event site that was created with the company confettiÂ´s tool for the company I work at. 

I used flexbox and fieldset as techniques to setup the hero video and signup form. 

If I hade more time I would learn more about the forms and try to style them better. I tried to make round check-boxes but it did not work out well and I also tried to remove the default setting of the forms but it also did not work out the way I would have liked.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
