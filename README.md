# Business Site

My business site with a sign up form for an upcoming event. 

The aim of the third project in the Web Dev bootcamp was to create a responsive business site with a hero image or video in the header  and a sign up form with at least 3 different input types.

## The problem

I started out by scetching out on paper how I wanted it to look like. I took inspiration from a landing page/event site that was created with the company confettiÂ´s tool for the company I work at. 

I used flexbox and fieldset as techniques to setup the hero video and signup form. Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
